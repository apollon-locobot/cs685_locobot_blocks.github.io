# Real Robotics Planning and Control with LoCoBot

This tutorial is an informal introduction to using the LoCoBot and a walkthrough of each of the components that make up our project. We'll also discuss some practical tips and the challenges we faced. The LoCoBots offer a variety of sensors and capabilities that are very accessible to beginners, students, and researchers. We only scratched the surface of what is possible. We hope that sharing our experience through this tutorial will assist future students in leveraging the GMU Autonomous Robotics Lab's fleet of LoCoBots. We look forward to the cool projects to come!
